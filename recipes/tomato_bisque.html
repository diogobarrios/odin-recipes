    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery with a pinch of salt until onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth and tomatoes into onion mixture. Bring to a simmer and season with paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. </li>
        <li>Turn heat to low and stir rice into soup; skim foam occasionally and simmer until rice and vegetables are very tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Add sugar.  </li>
        <li>Blend soup with an immersion blender in the pot until smooth. </li>
        <li>Whisk 1/2 cup cream into soup and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and sugar if needed. If soup is too thick, add more broth; if soup is too thin, cook, stirring often, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Ladle into warmed bowls; garnish each bowl with a drizzle of cream and top each with about 1 teaspoon chopped basil. </li>
    </ol>
